# CU-Unite-2.0

## Team: Vinita Sinha (vs339) and Aliva Das (ad677)

## Deployed Site : https://cu-unite.web.app

CU!Unite is a web-app to consolidate information about clubs, entities, and jobs across campus to ensure equitable access to resources. Using psychometric tests and NLP, we want to create a recommendation algorithm for possible campus activities for the user based on their personality and preferences. Users can post reviews about their experiences, providing useful insights. Using this feedback data, we would reiterate our product to better improve our services.

### Note: 
The scope of our project exceeded class project expectation and timelines. Given the number of weeks for the final project, we were able to develop all components of our app except the personality quiz, which was intended to be dynamic.

### More:

Cornell University has a wide variety of opportunities for students to engage with the community- through clubs, project teams, events, and on-campus jobs. Every year, Cornell invests considerable funds and resources on campus engagement, to help students make new social and professional connections, and learn technical and interpersonal skills. However, students get intimidated by the sheer number of resources that Cornell has to offer. Information about campus resources is scattered across various websites and social media, relying heavily on word of mouth to get spread. 


Students often end up joining clubs and jobs that have the most visibility i.e. clubs that have more members, more funding, and are social-media savvy - there is a lack of exposure for smaller clubs that cater to more niche interests. Besides students investing time in a commitment that they are disinterested in, the feeling of being left-out critically affects a student’s mental well being. 


There is a necessity for a product that will help students make efficient and well-informed choices in campus activities. Due to the lack of such a platform currently, new clubs find it difficult to reach out to people with similar interests and thus have an unstable organization with a low member retention rate. This reduces the club’s reach and group morale, which prevents members from achieving their goals, rendering clubs obsolete and the allocated university resources wasted.
